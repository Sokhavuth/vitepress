A love story between an aspiring actor and a promising director
whose parents were a married couple that had divorced 30 years ago.
Could they overcome such a complicated family relationship
and become a true family?
<br/><br/>
With a dream of becoming a famous actress, Eun-sung willingly takes charge of all those tedious chores at the theatre without a single complaint. One day, to celebrate her boyfriend Si-heon’s debut, Eun-sung dresses up as Si-heon’s favorite cat character and waits for him at the theatre. However, she witnesses Si-heon kissing the theatre owner’s daughter, Ju-ri. Confused and embarrassed, Eun-sung rushes out of the theatre, and Si-heon runs after her as soon as he discovers her. Running away in the middle of the night, Eun-sung bumps into a man. Seeing her embarrassed by people’s stares, the man takes off his jacket and offers it to her. But Eun-sung suddenly runs away with his jacket on, as she spots Si-heon approaching.
