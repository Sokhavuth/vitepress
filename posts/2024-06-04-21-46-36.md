Life is full of choices. Should I keep working at this job or quit?
What kind of work should I do to live well? Can I like this man or not?
Life is made up of all these choices, and each person's life is determined by them. In this life where every day is a series of choices, wouldn't it be nice if someone from the future appeared to make decisions and help you? This drama begins with such a bold imagination. 
<br/><br/>
And here, there is an ordinary 32-year-old woman who is struggling to survive day by day as a contract worker, not knowing when she will be laid off. 
<br/><br/>
One day, a lady appears and claims to be her future self, saying that she will correct the wrong choices she makes in the future and change her life.
<br/><br/>
Will the woman believe in her present choices or in the choices of her future self? 
<br/><br/>
This is a tale of two people, present self versus future self, who struggle to succeed in life. And it also asks those who hold the power of choice in their hands, just like that woman, what kind of life they really want and what happiness means in lifeâ€¦.
