Synopsis: In order to assassinate Minister Abbas, the presidential candidate who wanted to eliminate terrorist forces, the H-country Black Sun organization sent a killer to assassinate him while he was on a trip to China. The Shenying Anti-Terrorism Special Forces received the order and quickly dispatched, setting up a dragnet to arrest assassins and attack cross-border terrorists, which ultimately led to the signing of an anti-terrorism agreement between the two countries.
