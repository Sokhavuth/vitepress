He Wei, an insurance assessor in his thirties, is clean, polite and elegant. His wife Xiao Feng has just become pregnant, and his life is calm. Xiao Feng's parents died unexpectedly in his early years, leaving Xiao Feng and his sister Xiao Ke to depend on each other. Since childhood, Xiao Ke has been tortured by a brain tumor, and this terrible thing has almost grown up with her. Once again, the pathology report showed that her days were numbered. Twenty-year-old Xiao Ke hopes to feel a vigorous love in her limited life. She met Mr. Lin, who was equally depressed and behaved strangely like her, and their love began to heat up.
