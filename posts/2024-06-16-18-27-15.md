There is a chemical factory in the village where Song Sanmei lives. The business of the chemical factory is booming. While bringing benefits to the villagers, accidents of poisonous gas leakage and sewage water flow occur from time to time. Song Sanmei's cattle drank sewage and died, and her daughter was poisoned and sent to the hospital. Song Sanmei felt that life in the village should not be like this, and she began to try to petition and file a complaint, which changed her life and the fate of the chemical plant.
