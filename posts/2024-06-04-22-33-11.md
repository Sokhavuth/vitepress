Hyosim is a relentless breadwinner and works as a fitness trainer. Then, one day, a man registers for a personal training session at 5 a.m. Hyosim's joy from the expensive lesson fee is short-lived, and her pride is hurt when the man says he's unwilling to learn from her. Taeho, who went abroad to study as a child, returned to Korea to reveal the truth about his parentsâ€™ car crash and find his missing grandmother. However, as there are no new clues and his sleepless nights increase, he starts working out.
<br/><br/>
Taeho regarded Hyosim, the fitness trainer, as bothersome, but the two gradually understand each other's circumstances and open up to each other. However, when rumors spread about the two dating, Hyosim conflicts with her family and the fitness center. Eventually, Hyosim vanishes, and Taeho, who tries to find her no matter what, comes across a clue about the whereabouts of his missing grandmother. Will Tae-ho and Hyosim be able to overcome all of these hardships?
