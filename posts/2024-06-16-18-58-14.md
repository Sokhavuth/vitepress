In 1996, the rural economy and agricultural knowledge were generally backward at that time. Li Baoguo was determined to go to Hebei Gangdi to help farmers. When farmers questioned him, he issued military orders to the villagers time and time again, promoted new technologies, helped farmers start industries, and worked for farmers. Branding, helping farmers to upgrade their industries, finally touched the farmers and made them rich. At the same time, as an agricultural teacher, Li Baoguo learned that he was seriously ill. He hoped that his student Lu Chao would choose to stay in the Taihang Mountains to pass on his ideas and knowledge after graduation, and continue to take root in the Taihang Mountains to help farmers. Moved by the spirit, he strives to become a person like the teacher, helping more people get rid of poverty and become rich.
