The film takes the battle of crossing the Yangtze River as a backdrop and depicts the critical moment before the founding of the new China. A vanguard of the People's Liberation Army sneaked into the south of the Yangtze River, went to the Tiger's Cave to fight with wits and courage, and fought desperate battles with various enemies. For the reunification of the motherland, he sacrificed his life for justice and fought selflessly, finally crossing the Yangtze River together with millions of troops and raising red flags all over China.
