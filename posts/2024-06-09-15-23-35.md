The film tells the story of the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders in 1942 when they merged homes and villages along the Great Wall, drove the common people into concentration camp-like collective tribes, and cut off the Communist Eighth Route Army from contact with the people. The play describes the heroic feats of the Kuancheng Anti-Japanese Black Hawks, led by captain and national hero Qiao Blackhawk, in attacking the Japanese invaders and puppet troops led by Zuo Teng Nobuo, and the Wangchanggou Village Party branch uniting the masses to firmly support.
