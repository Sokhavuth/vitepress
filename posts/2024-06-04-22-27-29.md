Yeon-du’s life seemed perfect, as she has achieved a successful career as well as a satisfying personal life. She is maintaining her position as a top-rated lecturer, teaching at a private institution. Beside Yeon-du stands a handsome, warm-hearted lover who supports her. Tae-gyeong is far from believing in love. As a child, Tae-gyeong’s mother had a second marriage. Tae-gyeong was happy that his mother found the love of her life again, not knowing that his stepfather is from a family which founded a big enterprise. Tae-gyeong’s stepfamily did not welcome him and his mother, treating them like a thief who would steal the inheritance. And his first love Sae-jin, refused to be his lover just because he is a stepson of the family.
<br/><br/>
As the relationship between Yeon-du and Tae-gyeong begins as a lie to fool everyone, overcoming it and making a ‘real’ family will require more than they would imagine.
