Drug dealer Ma Yimin called his girlfriend Su Lina to wait for him at the train station with drugs. The police closely monitored Surina, who was planning to meet Ma Yimin at the train station, but she made a phone call at the station and suddenly didn't get on the train. Instead, she took a taxi to the bus station. Police officer Liu Shuang, who was monitoring Su Lina, followed her on a long-distance bus to Ruan Shui. Ma Yimin used undercover agents to test if there were any police officers in the car while remotely controlling Su Lina's actions through his phone. Just as he thought it was safe to meet Su Lina, Liu Shuang rushed out and caught them.
