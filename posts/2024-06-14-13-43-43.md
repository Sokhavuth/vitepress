The son of villager 61 was bitten by the dog of village director Li Authoritative's family. Qiu Huoda said that 61 had not tied the sheep properly in the field just now, and the sheep of the 61 family had gnawed their seedlings. Three villagers and one dog, due to the dog biting a person and the sheep biting a seedling, led to a dispute between the village head and villager 61. Later, the dog was lost, and the village head also died. 61 found the dog, and the village head's death 61 couldn't be explained, leading to a series of rural comedies.
