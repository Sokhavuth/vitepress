Married couple Min-ho and Gyeong-ae are worried about their three sons, who seem to have no intention of making a family. A doctor, a lawyer, and their handsome youngest son. At first, people envied the couple for raising their children so well, but now, even the sons' grandfather, Gyeong-cheol, is concerned that his grandsons might never get married. After losing his daughter when he was young, Gyeong-cheol adopted and raised Min-ho.
