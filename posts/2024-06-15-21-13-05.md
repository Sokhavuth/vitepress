The film tells what happened between the age of 12 and 14 when the leader of the labor movement, Lin Xiangqian, was 12 to 14 years old. He met progressive young people in his hometown, learned to read and write in private schools, and worked as an apprentice in Mawei Shipyard... All kinds of things that happened in his youth established his character of not fearing violence, daring to act, and always fighting for the interests of the working class.
