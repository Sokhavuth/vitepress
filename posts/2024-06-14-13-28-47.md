Yu Lili and Zhou Hongling went to Tibet with Fang Di and six cameras to visit Fang Songlin, while teaching Tibetan children how to make TV and movies. On the way to Tibet, a series of events occurred with Tibetan people such as Yang Jin, children like Nima, Dawa, and Zhaxi. They finally met for about 20 years before raising the national flag at the border of Tibet.
