Gao Zifang, a kind-hearted and simple rural woman who is not satisfied with the status quo, took care of her blind mother-in-law for six years when her ex-husband left her to enjoy life in the city. Her ex-husband was cheated on, came back full of scars and disrupted her wedding, so she kept him out of the overall situation for the embarrassing mother-in-law. She opened a trading company based on integrity and formed a trade association to help her ex-husband and mother-in-law reunite.
