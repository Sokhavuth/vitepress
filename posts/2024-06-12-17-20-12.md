In the 1920s, the Liu Family Winery was well-known throughout the country. In an accident, Liu’s patriarch’s house underwent a dramatic transformation and died, leaving behind an unmarried daughter and a twelve-year-old son. After that, Lin Zijing and Liu Mingyue became the victims of this marriage. The story revolved around a dispute over a wine party, which cast a shadow over the twelve years of married life of the hero and heroine. Lin Zijing's twisted mentality and Liu Mingyue's involuntary behavior filled a supposedly happy family with violence. A love-hate couple buried their true love in the wine that bound them for twelve years. The evil they planted on each other will be with them throughout their lives and become eternal pain.
