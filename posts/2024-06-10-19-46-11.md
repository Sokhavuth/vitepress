The movie tells the story of a singer who was labeled a leftist during the Cultural Revolution and sent to the countryside. Although he went to the countryside, he missed his girlfriend in the city. Just when he was despairing of life, a boy's singing gave him new hope and motivation for his life. From then on, he began teaching singing to boys in the countryside, but the faith and dream in his heart were never extinguished.
