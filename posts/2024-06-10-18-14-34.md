Sun Bucheng, the owner of the coffin shop hidden in Tumen Town, is actually the villain Vulture from many years ago. His daughter, Hasna, traveled thousands of miles to search for her father but brought disaster. Hyena, the former brother of Vulture, entered Tumen Town to find out why Vulture abandoned his brother. Vulture sacrificed himself and recognized the father and daughter before his death, while Hyena and other evil bandits were eliminated by Ge Li, Ye Qun and others.
