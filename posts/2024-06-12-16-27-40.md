Wu Rigen fell in love with Na Renhua, but she married Tao Ke. Tao advised Wu Rigen to beat the Japanese with him, but was rebuffed. The Japanese also came to defeat Wu Rigen and were taunted. In their anger, they robbed Wu Rigen's horse. Tao Ke got the people to help Wu Rigen, who finally joined forces with Tao Ke, Hong Geer and others and crushed the Japanese army. Unfortunately, Wu Rigen was shot and died while trying to save Hong Geer. Everyone was still in mourning, and a large number of Japanese soldiers entered the grasslands again. Tao Ke finally decided to search for the "red army" in the pass. Drive the Japanese out of the grasslands...
