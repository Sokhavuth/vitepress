The story takes place in the sunny 1980s, when Qi Lin, a woman who was released from prison in the mid-1980s, returned home early from her sentence and found that things had changed and the nest of magpies had been occupied. Defending emotions or becoming a beautiful person? After a series of difficult choices, Qilin fell back into a difficult and chaotic life. At the same time, a wonderful chemical reaction occurred between Zhou Kunpeng, a confused and ignorant young man. They went from not intersecting to influencing each other, and in the process of finding the meaning of life together, they developed a kind of "love". However, due to age differences, this "love" became somewhat difficult to speak of. At a time when I was deeply lost, a wicked cause from prison flew in, tearing apart the two I deeply loved and talking to each other in tears.
