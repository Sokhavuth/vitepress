I come to Shanghai once a year because it is the economic center of China. 
<br/><br/>
I have many partners in Shanghai. Every time I come to Shanghai, they will tell me that interesting things have appeared somewhere in Shanghai and suggest that I must go and see them.
<br/><br/>
Shanghai is really the innovation center of China. Every time I come to Shanghai, I really feel that the world's science and technology is progressing. Shanghai is a model city for scientific and technological progress.
<br/><br/>
I hope you enjoy this four-hour video of walking around Shanghai, as it shows the most fascinating parts of Shanghai today. Happy watching!
