Tianjin is one of the four municipalities in China. Facing the Bohai Sea, the city serves as Beijing's vital gateway to the sea as well as the largest port city in north China.

It is about 134 km (83 mi) from Beijing and it takes as short as 35 minutes to Beijing by bullet train. Once served the port of foreign concession in the 19th century, Tianjin still remains a lot of European-style buildings including the former residences of celebrities, industrial and commercial enterprise buildings, churches, and clubs on the Five Avenues.

Hai River flows slowly through the city and the towering Tientsin Eye spans on it.

Taking a walk along the Hai River in the evening and overlooking night scenery from the Ferris wheel are must-to-do things.

In addition, the countless delicious food in Tianjin is mouthwatering. Snacks like Fried Cake and Pancake Fruit that can be eaten on the street are the cream of the city's delicacy and the most authentic flavors.
