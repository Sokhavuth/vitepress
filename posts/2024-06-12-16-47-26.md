In the spring of 1937, a small group of Japanese troops was stationed in the city of Fuwang in Japanese-occupied central China, controlling the population in name but in reality strictly guarding the security of Camp No.103 of a secret underground arsenal. After learning of the enemy, the Communist Army sent a secret agent to infiltrate the Japanese army in Fuwang Town to obtain information about Warehouse No.103.
