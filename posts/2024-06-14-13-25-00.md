In the mid-1990s, many Village communities in the Taihang Mountains in northern China were merged into large villages. There are only two households left on the Shili Ridge, the Laiyu family and the Deku family. Laiyu has a son named Goulu, and there are five people on the ridge. After the summer vacation, Wang Fushun, a teacher, was sent to the district school. Wang Fushun only found out when he arrived at the mountain that he was asked to teach one student and one teacher taught another. After staying all night, Fushun decided to go down the mountain and stopped teaching this student. On the way down the mountain, he met Dog Egg. Dog Egg said, 'If you don't teach me, I won't have a teacher anymore. What else should I attend?'? Fushun saw Dog Egg's tearful eyes and decided to stay.
