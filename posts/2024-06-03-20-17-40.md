Mangshi, means “the City of Dawn” in Dai dialect, because it was right in the dawn when Buddha came to this city according to the legend. It is located in the southwest of Yunnan Province,  and it’s also the capital city of Dehong Prefecture. Mangshi is closed to Burma, thus it’s an important window for culture exchange between China and Burma and border port for trading and transportation. 
<br/><br/>
Mangshi is a classic national minority border city, so it has very thick and authentic ethnic customs, plus its pretty landscape. 
<br/><br/>
Therefore it has nicknames, such as “the Hometown of Peacock”  and “the City of Dawn”.
