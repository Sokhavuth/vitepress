On November 23, 1942, the anti-Japanese base of Jiaodong was "bloodily beaten" by 20,000 Japanese soldiers, and thousands of people were besieged on the mountain. The soldiers of the Seventh Company and the Sixth Squadron of the Fifth Brigade and the Thirteenth Regiment of the Eighth Route Army passed by Mount Mashishan after completing their mission and unexpectedly knew that the people were in danger of being robbed and killed on a large scale by the Japanese army. Therefore, they decided to stay and rescue the people. Under the command of Wang Dianyuan, a troop leader, ten soldiers with different personalities broke through the enemy fire net three times and brought more than a thousand people to safety. Seven soldiers were killed in the battle and three soldiers ran out of bullets. The enemy rushed in. They pulled and helped each other and sang battle songs in front of the enemy. When the bullets hit them, they were still standing upright and despising the enemy.
