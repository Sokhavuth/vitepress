The Cangshan mountain is huge and the sea of clouds is great. The sun shines through the dense foliage and casts dappled patches of light on the mountain forest. A shotgun in the forest is pointed at a wolf by the stream. As a wolf slowly turns into a pack of wolves, Tian Da grabs the shotgun and returns empty-handed. Since the Japanese invasion, Tian Da has made his daughter-in-law and his young son hide in the deep mountains and forests to go hunting. But since the day she entered the forest, she didn't hear Tian Da fire a single shot. Even several sheep in the enclosure were killed by wolves without Tian Da firing a single shot. Thus, day after day, she lived in hardship but in peace.
