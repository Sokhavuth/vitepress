After his son failed the college entrance examination and had no choice but to return to his home in the mountains, his father, who had been a postman in a mountain village for most of his life, retired early and arranged for his son to take over his job. On his son's first day at work, his father was still worried despite repeated warnings, so he decided to accompany his son on another letter-delivery trip with his loyal old dog who had been by his side for many years. At first, the father and son only walked in silence due to the long-term estrangement. Gradually, through contact with different villagers, especially a beautiful girl, the two gradually opened up their conversation and gained a deeper understanding of each other. In the beautiful and picturesque scenery, the son gradually understood the hard work and significance of his father's work, and the father gradually realized the debt he had owed to the family for more than 20 years.
