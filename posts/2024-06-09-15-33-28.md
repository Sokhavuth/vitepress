Lucy, a kind-hearted prostitute, had to rely on Li Liheng, the director of the intelligence department, in order to survive, and endured Li's perverted personality and cruel love with her weak body. Luo Fei, who was forced to hide in the closet due to circumstances, cleaned up Lucy. The act of wounding and the life-saving grace given to Lucy's relatives were what truly won her heart. In the end, Lucy gave up her life in exchange for Luo Fei's life, and the fragile love ended sadly before it had time to bloom.
