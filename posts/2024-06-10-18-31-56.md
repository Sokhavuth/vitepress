In 1933, a major earthquake occurred in Diexi, a small town in the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The hereditary chieftain of Xiazhu, An Dengbang, took the lead in fighting the disaster...but the Kuomintang Songpan government officials used various excuses such as "resisting the red bandits" to forcefully collect taxes and rape the people. This caused strong dissatisfaction among the people represented by An Dengbang. For the benefit of the local people, An Dengbang took the lead in resisting donations and taxes, and even led the crowd to rob the execution ground. On his way out of Beichuan to "escape from trouble", An Dengbang was injured in a fierce battle with the pursuing Sichuan army. He happened to encounter the Red Army at a critical moment...
