It tells a rough love story that during the Cultural Revolution, Yi Chujian, a young literary and artistic man, and Chen Ruozhi, a female painter, used to be a couple of lovers who fell in love with each other because of art, but were strongly opposed by his father. In order to escape his father's forced marriage, Yi Chujian went to the poor and remote areas alone to support education in the border areas, and finally fell in love fruitlessly.
