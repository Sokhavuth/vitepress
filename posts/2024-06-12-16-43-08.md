During the anti-Japanese war, Shanwa's family of three lived peacefully in the Taihang Mountains. One day, Japanese soldiers erected a weapons tower at the pass, which greatly disturbed Shanwa's family, and the peaceful life was soon interrupted. The Japanese soldiers spotted the boy hunting and shot him. The bullet pierced one of the boy's ears and almost killed him. This made the innocent Shanwa angry. The stubborn mountain child had to give expression to his anger that was pent up in his heart. Regardless of his wife's coaxing, he came to the opposite side of the blockhouse at dawn, shouting curses and demonstratively firing guns. This angered the Japanese soldiers, they chased them into the mountains several times and eventually found Shanwa's house. The Japanese soldiers inhumanely killed Shanwa's wife and children, but Shanwa escaped by chance. From then on, Shanwa fought a desperate battle with the Japanese soldiers.
