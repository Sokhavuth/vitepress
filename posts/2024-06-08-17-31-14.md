Synopsis: The film shares a touching story of the Second and Sixth Red Army Corps entering Yunnan in 1936 as the vanguard of the Red Army's Long March. It clearly plays the spirit of the great Long March and vividly expresses the firm ideals and beliefs and deep feelings of the people of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as He Long, Ren Bishi, Xiao Ke, and Wang Zhen.
