Synopsis: The film tells the story of Tong Zhongyi, who has practiced swords, guns and sticks for half his life, but when the Japanese were about to take action and the Chinese people killed each other, he regretted it. He no longer competed with others to gain a temporary advantage, but he managed to make everyone in Cangzhou martial arts. With his superb wrestling skills and noble martial ethics, he stood on the world stage and was called the "Wrestling God" by the Chinese.
