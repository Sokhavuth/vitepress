Due to a classification technicality, Chongqing municipality can claim to be the largest city proper in the worldâ€”though it does not have the world's largest urban area. Chongqing is the only city in China with a permanent population of over 30 million, however this number includes a large rural population.

Among them, the total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million. Shanghai is China's most populous urban area while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with the largest permanent population of over 30 million.

Most of travelers come to Chongqing are mainly for the relaxing 4 / 5 days Yangtze River cruise, but, the city itself, has many things to see and explore. If you like, you can spend another half day to two days visiting the mountain city and around.

The most important city in western China and the economic engine of the upper Yangzi, Chongqing City is a massive and enthralling urban sprawl. Chongqing makes up for a lack of top-notch sights with fantastic food and charismatic geography: its combination of steep hills at the confluence of the Yangzi and Jialing Rivers is a prelude to the even more dramatic scenery of the Three Gorges downstream.
