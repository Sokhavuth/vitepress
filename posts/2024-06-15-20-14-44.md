It is said that the Pegasus once made an appointment with the god horse in Xuefeng, and provided enough good horses to the Dawan royal family every year in exchange for the protection of the Dawan royal family. But the Benma tribe was ambitious to replace them, and the head of the Pegasus fell seriously ill at this time. Zhang Qian helps the Tianma tribe find Tianma to overcome difficulties.
