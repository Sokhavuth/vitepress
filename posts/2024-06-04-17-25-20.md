Synopsis:<br/> 
Gu Yancheng, the successor of the Gu Group who lost the ability to carve, met Yu Xuan, who looked like the woman in the "Flying Fairy" handed down by his family for thousands of years. The strangest thing was that he would rush forward to protect Yu Xuan if he saw that she was in danger. In order to verify his reaction, and also made sure that Yuxuan was helpful in recovering his carve skill, Gu Yancheng designed Yuxuan to become his driver and assistant and live in his home. The two of them started a "cohabitation" life that they hated each other but never left. They fell in love with each other when they got along...
