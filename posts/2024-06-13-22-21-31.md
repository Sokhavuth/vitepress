Daniel Lam is a single man with a small career, self and pursuit of perfection. Due to deep conflicts with his father who is far away from home, the two have lost contact for many years. Although he runs his own bar independently, he always feels a lack of warmth from home. As the Spring Festival approaches, he is determined to end his single life and marry his girlfriend Liu Ying back home. Unexpectedly, Daniel Lam's marriage plan is not so easy to achieve. At first, the scene of proposing marriage was in a state of confusion, and then we encountered trouble during the door-to-door proposal. The future father-in-law was worried about Daniel Lam's sense of family responsibility. In order to test Daniel Lam, he deliberately asked his father to attend the wedding. Lin didn't want to bow to his father, so he had a brainstorm and invited Taiwanese stuntman Chen Bangda, who often drinks in bars, to impersonate his father. Chen Bangda is an alcoholic. During their contact, two men unexpectedly discovered each other's spiritual secrets and found the feelings between their long lost father and son.
