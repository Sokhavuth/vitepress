The film is based on the historical facts of Zhou Xihan, the Chief of Staff of the 386th Brigade of the Eighth Route Army. The founding general Zhou Xihan fought countless battles in his life, and this film selects two famous ones: the rescue of Yangerling and the deployment of the artillery regiment. By describing these two wars, Zhou Xihan is portrayed as a brave and resourceful hero. The film also tells the story of the meeting between him and his wife Zhou Xuan, showing another side of him beyond his iron bones. The actors are sincere, the story has ups and downs, and the battle scenes are great.
