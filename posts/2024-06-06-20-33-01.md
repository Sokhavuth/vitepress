Synopsis: There is a group of horse bandits headed by Tang Zhan active near Tumen Town - the Dang Kou Gang, who often rob the rich and give to the poor. They robbed a caravan that was supposed to be delivering tea but was actually delivering arms to the mayor. The second master, Hong Kun, became ambitious, betrayed Tang Zhan, and eradicated dissidents. Ge Li, Ye Qun and others met and understood Tang Zhan, and joined forces with him to settle their grudges with Hong Kun.
