The movie tells the story of Xiao En, who disappeared from the world after being recruited into the army. He and his daughter Gui Ying depended on each other and made a living by fishing. However, unexpectedly, their beloved daughter was spotted by a local tycoon who wanted to take her as his own. In addition, there were droughts and floods. It was shallow and unable to catch fish, so the local eunuch Ding Shixie urged him to pay the fishing tax. Just when Xiao Qi was feeling depressed, his former friends Li Jun and Ni Rong came to visit and learned of the incident, so they joined forces with Xiao En to lead the fishermen to fight wits and courage with local tyrants.
